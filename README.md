# Sticker-spacer polymers in active bath
This repository contains LAMMPS input scripts, data files, and generated outputs for simulations of sticker–-pacer polymers immersed in passive or active Brownian particle baths. The analysis script and processed data used for figure generation are provided in the Analysis directory, organized into Cluster_Data, Rg_Data, Partition_Data, and Plots.
