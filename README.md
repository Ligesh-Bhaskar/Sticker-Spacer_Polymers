# Sticker-spacer polymers in active bath
This repository contains LAMMPS input scripts, data files, and generated outputs for simulations of sticker–-pacer polymers immersed in passive or active Brownian particle baths. The analysis script and processed data used for figure generation are provided in the Analysis directory, organized into Cluster_Data, Rg_Data, Partition_Data, and Plots.

### Analysis

The `Analysis/` directory contains the scripts and processed data used to generate the figures in the article:
- `Cluster_Data/`: polymer and solvent cluster statistics  
- `Rg_Data/`: radius of gyration measurements  
- `Partition_Data/`: phase partitioning and enrichment data  
- `Plots/`: final plots used in the paper
